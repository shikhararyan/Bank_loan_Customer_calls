# Project Summary: Data Analysis of Portfolio and Communication History

## Introduction
This project involves the analysis of two datasets: a portfolio dataset containing information about loan portfolios, and a communication history dataset containing information about communication interactions with customers. The aim of the project is to gain insights into customer behavior and loan portfolio trends.

## Data Analysis Process
1. **Loading Data Sets**: Two datasets are loaded - Portfolio Data Set and Communication History Data Set.
2. **Checking Data Sets**: Information about the datasets is checked using the `info()` method to understand their structure.
3. **Previewing Data**: The first few rows of each dataset are displayed using the `head()` method to get an overview of the data.
4. **Checking for Null Values**: Null values in each dataset are identified using the `isnull().sum()` method to handle missing data appropriately.
5. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Various data analysis and visualization techniques are applied to the datasets, including distribution analysis of loan amounts by state, loans by due dates, calls by state, calls by campaign ID, age calculation from date of birth, and distribution of customers by age.
6. **Conclusion**: The project provides insights into loan portfolios and communication history, enabling better decision-making and understanding of customer behavior.

## Conclusion
Through comprehensive data analysis and visualization techniques, this project aims to provide valuable insights into loan portfolios and communication history, facilitating informed decision-making processes and enhancing understanding of customer behavior patterns.
